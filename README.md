# Econometric-Analysis-of-Attendance-Data
Developed a binary-choice logit model of lecture attendance using student-lecture panel data with features including quiz-announcement status, time-period indicators, and spatial distance.

Applied fixed-effects estimation to correct for unobserved heterogeneity and computed log-odds, marginal effects, and partial effects for policy-relevant covariates.
